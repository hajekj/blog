I am Jan, hi. People also call me Honza , "Haichi" (ハイチー) or HH ("double-H") and I am also known as [Honza Noyes](https://my.secondlife.com/honza.noyes) in Second Life.

I am co-founder of a company called [NETWORG](https://thenetw.org) (previously TheNetw.org) which focuses on development, consulting and IT activities not limited only to the Czech Republic.

On 1st of August 2018 I received a [Microsoft Most Valuable Professional award](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5003178?fullName=Jan%20%20Hajek) (MVP) in Microsoft Azure category!

I am passionate about Microsoft technologies, especially Microsoft Azure and ASP.NET Core. I also work with JavaScript / TypeScript / Node.js and PHP. I am also interested into identity (especially Azure AD) and security.

I like to spend time learning about new technologies and share my experience with others through my blog, various conferences or podcasts and videos.
