  Thanks for writing this up! After running into the same issue, I went down a
  rabbit hole trying to see if the issue was related to ITP 2.0, and came up
  with nothing.


  Disabling the SameSite property is a quick (but less secure) fix. Hopefully
  the WebKit folks can prioritize this issue and resolve it soon.
