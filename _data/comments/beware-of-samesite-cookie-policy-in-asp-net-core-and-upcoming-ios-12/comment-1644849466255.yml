  I tried the above options. Still samesite not working in Safari. I am using
  Asp .Net Core 3.1 with React SPA template. Both frontend and backend deployed
  independently. If I am not wrong, I need to make these changes on frontend
  which is build using (ASP.NET Core app with React js template). Any help would
  be appreciated.
