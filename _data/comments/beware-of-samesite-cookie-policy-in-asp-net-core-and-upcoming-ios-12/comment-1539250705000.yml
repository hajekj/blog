  Great question! You are likely using the bits from
  https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureAD.UI/
  package? If so, you need to register CookieAuthenticationOptions into the DI
  container before calling AddAzureAD. With the CookieAuthenticationOptions you
  can configure the cookie SameSite policy and it should work just fine. Please
  do let me know if it worked for you or not.


  AddAzureAD source for reference:
