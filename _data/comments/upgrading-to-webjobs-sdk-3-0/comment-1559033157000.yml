  Thanks for writing this, but having screwed around with this latest version of
  Web Jobs for a couple of days, hitting bug after bug with no documentation,
  and being completely new to Web Jobs, I'm sticking with version two. Updating
  the Web Jobs project template makes everything break! I tried working with V1
  of Azure Functions but there were so many package conflicts that I moved on to
  Version 2, but the new framework it's based on (.NET Core or Standard, or
  whatever it is) wouldn't work with my .NET web app code. The whole thing has
  just been a big dumpster fire of pain. I really can't believe how unusable and
  undocumented these products are when ASP.NET and Azure have been so good in
  the past.


  So, one thing I can't for the life of me figure out, if, as you said, "SDK 3.0
  brings WebJobs much closer to ASP.NET Core", is it still the old .NET? Or is
  it .NET Core, or Standard? And assuming they fix the usability and
  documentation problems, will V3 work with old .NET Framework code?
