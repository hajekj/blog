  Thanks for the post, really useful and well written. I found the information
  about OnSigningIn event of cookie middleware extremely useful. I would only
  add one thing: using in-memory store is not always a good option, because
  scaling to multiple instances of the application then requires sticky
  sessions, which is a nuisance. That's because memory is not shared among
  processes and different instances of the application, so in-memory store works
  only if requests from the same user are always handled by the same instance.
  This should be mentioned at the end of the article.
