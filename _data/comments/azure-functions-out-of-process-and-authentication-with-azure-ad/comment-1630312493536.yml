message: "Thanks for the post. \r\n\r\nWhen dotnet 5 support for Azure Functions was announced I thought this was great news. A few months into porting my apps from 3.1 I’ve realised I started too soon.\r\n\r\nI’ve hit this problem securing my app and also a major issue where I’m receiving grpc timeouts. \r\n\r\nIt’s a shame because dotnet-isolated is clearly the future but my advice would be don’t migrate yet."
