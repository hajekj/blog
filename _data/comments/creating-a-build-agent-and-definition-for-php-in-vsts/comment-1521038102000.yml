  So you would probably be best off with building a Docker container and then
  deploying the container to your machines. You can either handle the deployment
  manually or setup some orchestrator like Kubernetes (or even used Azure
  Container Service - AKS, as a managed container platform which can run both
  Linux and Windows, and also uses Scale Sets).

  If you have a Scale Set deployed, do the machines have connection to some
  shared storage? Like Azure Files or each of the machine is independent?
