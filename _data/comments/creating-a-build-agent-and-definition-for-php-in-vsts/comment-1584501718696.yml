message: "Michael Stagliano took the time to relax with The Examiner to respond to a few questions about his music.\r\nThank you Michael for as well as effort and we look forward to seeing you \r\nin Indianapolis at Birdys on October 4th!\r\n\r\nA: I'd love to make another record with those guys.\r\n\r\nBut about important agenda. It takes eight months carryout a \r\nWinger record, and I all operate. I'd like to do it, having said that \r\ni have a lot of other crap on my plate. And also the \r\nKarma is our best, actually. I'm all about continuing for more and not put the same crap \r\nor drinks . album on a regular. Let me install it in future.\r\nTake a band like the where to play 918kiss. They continue \r\nto kick ass. Everything they put out improves on the thing they put out, inside \r\nmy opinion, and that's where I'm coming from as an artist.\r\nWe probably will do another one particular.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow many . where things aren't as clear - I recall music, nevertheless i moreso while you feeling.\r\n\r\nHad been amazing. Their music was psychedelic and progressive,\r\nserious rock yet you could lose yourself in a dancing madness.\r\nI danced challenging that my sunglasses flew off my head, and then a good concert-going samaritan taught \r\nme to be find them in the dark. I basically lost myself in the music.\r\nInside your took costs people love about latin music and fused it \r\nwith what we love about rock n' roll, yard be this sound.\r\n\r\nThat may be this band. I fell for each other.\r\n\r\nYep, it's completely gone through. The artwork is done, songs are done,\r\nand Wind Up just needs some time do their jobs; will be promote and set up up the album, and yes,\r\nit comes in February.\r\n\r\nAgain, not collection the bar too top I grew up when the Monkees were on television and Bay City Rollers \r\nwere topping the stock charts. But the lyrics to the Miley \r\nCyrus hit \"Party in the USA\" just me cringe. Apparently, she's a country girl choice a plane in LAX (never heard that one before) with \"a dream and my cardigan\" can be wowed through the \r\nHollywood Sign and adequate that \"everybody seems so famous\" until her cab driver switches on the radio \"and the Jay Z song was on.\" Works well with me \r\nactually. Hear Jay Z and damaging of relaxation rushes over me.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne belonging to the signatures this festival is the actual bamboozling of potential clients.\r\nThis comes in two forms. First there the particular mystery band names.\r\nIn years past the check saw acts such as Bearfort as well as the Great American Freedom Machine which in reality \r\nwere Thursday and Motion City Soundtrack. The other bamboozle is acts \r\nthat don't match regular alt rock and punk fall into line. The festival has seen makes Weird Al, Snoop Dogg, Bret Michaels and Motley Crue.\r\nYr the headliner could classify in that group - Bon Jovi.\r\nHowever, is actually not more likely that he was \r\nchosen to showcase the Jersey roots and heart of this occurence festival.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce we signed with Wind Up we had been couple of songs prepared to go,\r\nand we took a couple of more months, basically until June to \r\nwrite. We had our productive states out on Long Island and \r\nwent there a a few times full week. We would talk about \r\nthe songs, play them over and over, and realize new parts and annoyed when someone came as a couple.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe music festivals right here are the \"big boys\"; \r\ntickets these festivals often sell-out with a few hours \r\nof the events taking a sale. However, there are music festivals of all \r\nshapes and sizes and catering to each tastes happening across \r\nthe uk during summer time months."
