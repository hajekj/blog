message: "Great article!\r\nI am trying to implement Single Logout on a javascript implementation and cannot get Azure AD B2C to call the Logout URL on the Application setting. \r\nAny chance you could share a code to accomplish this? Just 2 javascript pages, as 2 applications on Azure B2C, and one Tenant. This pages are not SPA, they do refresh the HTML from time to time."
