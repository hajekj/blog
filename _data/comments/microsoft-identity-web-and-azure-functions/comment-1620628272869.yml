  Great point @saurabh. This is a known issue, partially covered here:
  https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-identity-web/issues/916. To mitigate this
  error on startup, make sure that all your HTTP triggers are set to Anonymous
  level. Eventually, you could also try following:
  https://hajekj.net/2021/04/22/azure-functions-out-of-process-and-authentication-with-azure-ad/
  to make other authorization types work as well (like the Functions key). You
  can use the same code with in-process hosting model as well.
