  Hi Honza!


  First off, thanks for your posts - they have been way more helpful than the
  official docs.


  I am, however, running into some issues trying to build my own image, based on
  the official php:7.2-fpm image. The issue I'm having right now is when I
  attempt to add SSH support to my image. This is the important parts of my
  current Dockerfile (I hope this comes out alright in the comment):


  FROM php:7.2-fpm


  Install dependencies


  RUN apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y \
          [...] &amp;&amp; \
      apt-get clean &amp;&amp; rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* &amp;&amp; \
      docker-php-ext-install \
          [...] &amp;&amp; \
      docker-php-ext-configure gd \
          [...] &amp;&amp; \
      docker-php-ext-install gd

  Add Azure SSH config


  COPY init_container.sh /bin/

  RUN echo "root:Docker!" | chpasswd \
      &amp;&amp; apt update \
      &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends openssh-server \
      &amp;&amp; chmod 755 /bin/init_container.sh
  COPY sshd_config /etc/ssh/


  Expose ports and start php-fpm server


  EXPOSE 2222 9000


  CMD ["/bin/init_container.sh"]


  This is my init_container.sh:


  #!/bin/bash

  service ssh start

  touch /home/LogFiles/node_${WEBSITE_ROLE_INSTANCE_ID}<em>out.log

  echo "$(date) Container started" &gt;&gt;
  /home/LogFiles/node</em>${WEBSITE_ROLE_INSTANCE_ID}_out.log


  /usr/local/sbin/php-fpm


  As you can probably tell, I've took chunks from your repo to try and adapt to
  my config, but something seems to be off.


  The image builds alright but when I try to run it, I'm just getting the
  following error from my container: "/usr/local/bin/docker-php-entrypoint: 9:
  exec: /bin/init_container.sh: not found".


  If I run "docker run my_image ls -Al /bin/", I can see that init_container.sh
  is there, and the file permissions look like everything else in /bin/.


  Do you have any idea what could be the issue here?


  Thanks!

  Erik
