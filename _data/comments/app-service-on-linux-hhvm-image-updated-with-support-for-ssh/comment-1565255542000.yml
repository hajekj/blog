  It seems I have finally found the solution to this problem. Changing the line
  endings from CRLF to LF seems to have done the trick (thanks to
  https://forums.docker.com/t/standard-init-linux-go-175-exec-user-process-caused-no-such-file/20025/8).


  The issue now seems to be running "az webapp create-remote-connection [...]"
  as I keep getting "Timeout Error, Unable to establish a connection".


  I've also tried WebSSH on Kudu, but my docker logs gives me this:

  Host from file: 172.16.1.7

  DEBUG: Local ident: 'SSH-2.0-ssh2js0.1.16'

  on.error - Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 172.16.1.7:2222


  Any idea?
