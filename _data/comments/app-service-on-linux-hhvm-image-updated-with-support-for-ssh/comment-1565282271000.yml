  Hi again, I figured I'd let you know how things have gone so far.


  By looking at Azure's PHP image and the Django sample
  (https://github.com/Azure-Samples/docker-django-webapp-linux) I've managed to
  get my image with working SSH on port 2222, although only locally. When I put
  it up on Azure, I can't create a tunnel with "az webapp
  create-remote-connection [...]" (error message "WARNING - Remote debugging may
  not be setup properly. Reponse content: FAILURE:2222:Unable to connect to
  WebApp") nor connect using WebSSH on Kudu (error message "connect ECONNREFUSED
  xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:2222").


  I feel like I've soon tried all the tricks and "hacks" people have come up
  with to try and get SSH working on their containers on the entire web.


  Did you run docker-compose on Azure with a working SSH image?
