  So in case you make a Single Page App, you wouldn't use Passport.js on
  frontend and instead use authentication within the SPA framework you use. For
  example ADAL for React, Angular etc.


  There is a difference between ADAL and MSAL - basically, MSAL is a successor
  of ADAL. You should be using MSAL nowadays when starting a new project unless
  you hit some big issues - haven't hit any myself yet. You can use ADAL and
  MSAL in the project (not at the same time tho) at different tiers of
  application - for example SPA with MSAL, backend with ADAL etc.
