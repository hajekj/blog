  Hi Jan


  I have configured Azure Ad as Web App and try to get authtenciated with
  passport and adal-node.I followed the same pattern you defined here.I have two
  problem here with acquireToken call.


  First there is conflict with api versions explained here

  https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-nodejs/pull/149


  spn: prefix is added to resource and i got no cached entry error because
  resource is not prefixed on cached version.


  This problem is solved removing the version assignment line indicated in the
  PR.


  Second,When cached version of accesstoken is expired,acquireToken function try
  to refresh requesting the token endpoint without clientSecret which is an
  error.


  As your app is configured in Azure as WebApp, there must be client secret.

  This is the error i faced.


  "AADSTS70002: The request body must contain the following parameter:
  'client_secret or client_assertion'.


  Any idea ?
