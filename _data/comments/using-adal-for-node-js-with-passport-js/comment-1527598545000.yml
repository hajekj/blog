  So in your case, I would do a following setup: a Single Page Application (SPA)
  to handle the front end, then your custom API and Micrsooft Graph. The SPA
  will authenticate the user directly (sample here
  https://github.com/Azure-Samples/react-aad-msal) and communicate with your API
  and MS Graph by passing the respective tokens for the services. On your custom
  API, you just validate the token and make sure that it contains the scope etc.
  and that the user is authorized to make the operation. In case you need to
  call other APIs from your own API, you can do so through "on-behlaf-of" flow -
  ADAL does the heavy lifting for you.
