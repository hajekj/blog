  From the source of the library, it doesn't seem to require not include the
  refresh token in the response
  (https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-nodejs/blob/81ff31dd612cae6cd69a9a7452171b7af792be9f/lib/token-request.js#L118)
  which could be a bug in this case - since client_secret is required when
  refreshing a token:
  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-protocols-oauth-code#refreshing-the-access-tokens


  Also, I think you best bet would be to obtain the tokens from the cache,
  checking expiration and if they expired, calling getTokenWithRefreshToken
  manually with obtained refreshToken from cache and you client secret. I can
  try to update the sample if it would be any useful for you.


  Aditionally, I would suggest moving away from using this application model,
  and switching either to SPA + API or some similar architecture since such
  backend authentication and advanced flows seem to be rather complicated with
  ADAL for Node.js.
