  I have already secured my backend api using azure-ad-jwt, it allows requests
  only with a valid token. thats done.

  regarding the sample you provided, I am little confused here. So will my SPA
  use passport_adal , adal node and aad-msal?? Feels passport is not needed in
  the front end app. Also access tokens for the 3 resources will be managed
  automatically by adal node?

  I dont want to use graph api as it doesnt exposes all functioanlities of
  sharepoint as of now. will have to explicity use 3 resource. And I have approx
  10 pages in my front end, how can I verify before going to each of the page
  that user is already authenticated?

  do we have a function in adal node which verifies if user is already logged in
  or so?
