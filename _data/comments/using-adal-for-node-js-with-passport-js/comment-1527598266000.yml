  Well, I am really new to NodeJS development and recently found about passport,
  not sure how does it work. Might be a really silly question to ask, but how do
  we manage users using both the approach? in some cases I would like my front
  end to make the direct call to the resources and in some cases my rest api,
  will need to make the call on behalf of the user. if they both get the tokens
  independently I am not sure how it will work or what security issue it might
  present.

  Right now I have the following setup

  nodejs express back end api protected by aad

  nodejs web server serving static web pages

  and in all I have to use 3 resources from aad. mu backend api, sharepoint api
  and email api

  management of access tokens for all 3 of them from both the places seems a
  tedious approach.

  I feel I am not seeing the obvious here, should be some cleaner way to do it.
