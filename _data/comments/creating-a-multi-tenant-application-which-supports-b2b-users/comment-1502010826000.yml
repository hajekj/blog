  Right, I just tried with a clean directory and I am hitting the same issue.
  The documentation states that Guests are synonymous to Members
  (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-b2b-user-properties#can-azure-ad-b2b-users-be-added-as-members-instead-of-guests)
  which makes it more confusing. I noticed you already wrote to Stack Overflow
  (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45487492/aadsts50034-to-sign-into-this-application-the-account-must-be-added-to-the-gu)
  so I voted it up. All we can do is wait for Microsoft's response in this case.
