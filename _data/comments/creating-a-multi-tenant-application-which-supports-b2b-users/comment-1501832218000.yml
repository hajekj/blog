  Thank you for the nice article. You saved my day. I have only one question.
  How can I fix a problem of getting tenants when user logged in directory where
  he is as Guest not a Member. The exception is looked like:


  Exception: {"error":"invalid_grant","error_description":"AADSTS50034: To sign
  into this application the account must be added to the GUID
  directory.\r\nTrace ID: GUID\r\nCorrelation ID: GUID\r\nTimestamp: 2017-08-03
  15:58:15Z","error_codes":[50034],"timestamp":"2017-08-03
  15:58:15Z","trace_id":"GUID","correlation_id":"GUID"}
