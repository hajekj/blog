  As far as I know, Microsoft is using OpenAPI.NET.CSharpAnnotations tool
  internally, so don't think it is abandoned, yet. I have been closely tracking
  the work on https://github.com/aliencube/AzureFunctions.Extensions/ and I am
  really impressed with the progress there. Really hoping Microsoft puts more
  effort into this.
