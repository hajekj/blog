  Hey Yasmine, I haven't got the Swagger UI working in this case. I usually
  visualize the definition via https://editor.swagger.io/. There have been
  projects to directly embed Swagger UI and load it from within the Azure
  Functions (like
  [this](https://medium.com/@yuka1984/open-api-swagger-and-swagger-ui-on-azure-functions-v2-c-a4a460b34b55)
  one), however it for example works only with v2 runtime and is not supported
  with v3 and so on. Also, I am not sure whether embedding the UI from within
  the Function is the most efficient thing to do - performance wise, since the
  Function will become quite large due to the included libraries.
