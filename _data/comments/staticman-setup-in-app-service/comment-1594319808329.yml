  Hi Jan, excellent posting with very clear instructions! The only change I made
  was hosting the forked staticman repo on Azure DevOps instead of Github, that
  way you get a very nice Azure DevOps Pipeline integration. Furthermore the
  *free personal* plan from AKISMET is also available if you create a Wordpress
  account, the API key you get is not limited to Wordpress sites. Thanks again!
