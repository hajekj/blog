  login_hint came close to force user to re-enter credentials.   However,
  browser profile sync just automatically bypasses upon account selection it the
  user has setup (similar to the save userid password when visiting many
  websites).   With the parameters option, why not a full querystring encryption
  share between the provider and application to prevent the user from
  manipulating or removing the values?
